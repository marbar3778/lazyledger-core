LazyLedger Core will power the LazyLedger main chain by leveraging Tendermint.

LazyLedger itself is a scale-out data availability-focused minimal blockchain.
It allows users to post arbitrary data on the chain, as well as define their own execution layers.
This data is ordered on-chain but not executed. This allows for the first scalable data layer for
decentralised applications, including optimistic rollup sidechains. Additionally, this design allows developers to
define their own execution environments.
